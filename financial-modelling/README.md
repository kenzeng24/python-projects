## Simulating Financial Data 

#### Model Training 

In order to train parameter theta for our model: 

```bash  
python3 train_model.py 
```
This will generate a file called 
```
theta.npy 
```

#### Data Generation 

To generate input noise  
```bash 
python3 generate_noise.py 
```
Which will produce the file 
```bash 
noise.csv 
```

To generate new datapoints from the gaussian noise:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
Which outpus: 
```bash
main.py 
```
